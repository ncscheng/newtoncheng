Hello and welcome! I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley in the Physics Department advised by [Raphael Bousso](https://lightsheet.berkeley.edu/). My research has primarily focused on understanding the interplay between quantum information and quantum gravity. To that end, my work has looked at various aspects of holography (AdS/CFT), quantum error correcting codes, entanglement measures, and random tensor networks. In recent times, my interests have turned towards machine learning, with a particular interest in understanding the underpinnings of deep learning, robustness and generalization, and all things NLP. Much of my current days are spent on rapidly developing my background in these fields, and I am on the hunt for interesting questions to tackle! 

I did my undergraduate studies at Stanford University, where I was fortunate enough to work with and write an honors thesis under [Shamit Kachru](https://sitp.stanford.edu/people/shamit-kachru), studying string-theoretic aspects of black holes.

I hold a long-standing interest in physics and mathematics education, and am passionate about using resesarch-driven pedagogy tools to more effectively teach and tutor. 

If you'd like to chat about any of the things above (or most other topics), feel free to drop me a line at my email: firstnamelastname at berkeley.edu.
